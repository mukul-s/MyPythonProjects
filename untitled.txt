i am doing my best here
i will bring home a trophy
who knows whats gonna happen in future so the only thing we can do is do our best and hope for the best

with this message i will be very bitter if i am not able to score a good position, good salary and better work from a reputed company and i will be very happy if i get that. But nonetheless i want to taste that bitterness or sweetness, i want to feel like the man in the arena not the man who make excuses but who delivers his best, actually better than this best.

I am growing every seconds. Matte Minna, i will be rocking in few months later.
